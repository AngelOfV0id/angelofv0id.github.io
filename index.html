			Hello! My name is Ivan Movchan, aka AngelOfV0id. I am 16 years old teenager living in Russia, Saint Petersburg (come from Murmansk region).<br>
			<br>
			Amateur developer (software engineer), I am interested in Windows programming and some web design. I mostly write in C and HTML + CSS + JavaScript, sometimes use Python and AutoHotkey (also tried C# and Delphi). I enjoy developing useless but interesting projects, most of which are available on my GitHub.<br>
			<br>
			Besides programming and computer stuff, I love music: I play piano (5+ years studying in musical school) and guitar (self-taught), also try to make my own electronic (mainly tracker) music. I enjoy listening Russian rock and metal, synthpop and some electronics. My favourite music artists/bands are "Kino", "Aria", "Technology", "Depeche Mode", "Autechre", "Aphex Twin" and much more...<br>
			<br>
			I also enjoy making photos (self-taught photographer, yay) and some drawing. I publish my works and news about my projects in my own Telegram channel.<br>
			<br>
