			<h2>0x00. About me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is Ivan Movchan.<br>
				I am
				<span class="mono">16</span>
				years old and I live in Russia, Saint Petersburg (born in Murmansk).
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the early childhood I am interested in computers and music. I am interested in programming and also trying myself in web design.<br>
				I study at musical school and play piano (+ a bit guitar). I am a big fan of electronic and tracker music and also interested in tracker music. I like listening 80-90s music, synthwave and sometimes hard rock.<br>
				Also I am (self-taught) photographer - making nice (I guess) photos. Sometimes I had been writing poems even, lol.
			</p>
			<p>
				Talking about my personality, I am modest and calm person. I do not use social media as I do not like them so much - I more prefer to spend my time on something more interesting (i. e. my projects) üòú
