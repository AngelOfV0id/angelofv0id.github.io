This repository contains source codes of my wonderful website: https://nobootrecord.github.io
Source codes are released in public domain, you can use them as you wish, I do not mind :-)

For oldschool lovers I have also drawn a little banner - it is placed in "banner.png" file.
You can attach it to your website using this code:

<a href="https://nobootrecord.github.io"><img src="https://nobootrecord.github.io/banner.png" alt="Ivan Movchan" title="Ivan Movchan / NobootRecord" /></a>

Have fun!!!
