					My name is <b>Ivan Movchan aka <span title="It is recommended to write my nickname with small 'b' and pronounce softly. The stress in the word does not matter so much">NobootRecord</span></b>.
					I was born in Russia, Murmansk on February, 18. Now I am <span class="mono" title="16, if you do not understand HEX :D">0x10</span> years old and live in Russia, Saint Petersburg.<br>
					<br>
					Since the early childhood I am interested in computers and music. I am interested in programming and also trying myself in web design.<br>
					I study at musical school, play piano (and a bit guitar). I am a big fan of electronic and tracker music and try to write my own tracker music. I like listening 80-90s music, synthwave and sometimes hard rock.<br>
					Also I am (self-taught) photographer, making nice (I guess) photos. Early I had been writing poems even, lol.<br>
					<br>
					Speaking mostly in Russian (native) & English, also Deutsch and Ukrainian (just for fun) languages.
					<br><br>
					Talking about my personality, I am modest and a bit shy (but still friendly) person. I barely use social media as I do not like them so much - I more prefer to spend my time on something more interesting (i. e. my projects) üòâ<br><br>
